        <p class="content">
          From 1977 to 1982, Cranston was married to writer Mickey Middleton. On
          July 8, 1989, he married Robin Dearden whom he had met on the set of
          the series Airwolf in 1984; he was playing the villain of the week and
          she played a hostage he held at gunpoint. Their daughter, actress
          Taylor Dearden (born February 12, 1993) was an extra on the Breaking
          Bad episode "No Más", directed by Cranston. Cranston played baseball
          when he was a student and remains a collector of baseball memorabilia.
          He is an avid fan of both the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Los Angeles
          Rams. During the 2022 MLB Celebrity Softball Game, Cranston was the
          first celebrity to be ejected after being struck by a pitch and
          jokingly threw a bucket of bubble gum at an umpire. When he accepted
          his third Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama
          Series, Cranston thanked his wife and daughter and told them he loves
          them "more than baseball". The family lived in a Ventura County,
          California beach house which Cranston designed. While filming Breaking
          Bad Cranston lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He was a co-owner of
          the former independent theater Cinemas Palme d'Or in Palm Desert,
          California. Cranston and castmate Aaron Paul both got Breaking Bad
          tattoos on the last day of filming to commemorate the final episode of
          Breaking Bad; Cranston's tattoo consists of the show's logo on his
          right ring finger, while Paul's tattoo consists of "no half measures"
          on his biceps. Cranston and Breaking Bad co-star Aaron Paul announced
          the release of their signature mezcal, Dos Hombres, in July 2019. In
          March 2020, Cranston contracted COVID-19 and recovered reportedly with
          mild symptoms. However, by December 2020, his sense of smell had only
          partially recovered.

        <div class="label"><a href="">Acting Career Started</a></div>
        <p class="content">
          After college, Cranston began his acting career in local and regional
          theaters, getting his start at the Granada Theater in the San Fernando
          Valley. He had previously performed as a youth, but his show-business
          parents had mixed feelings about their son being involved in the
          profession, so he did not act until years later. Cranston was ordained
          as a minister by the Universal Life Church, and performed weddings for
          $150 a service to help with his income. He also worked as a waiter,
          night-shift security guard at the gates of a private LA community,
          truck loader, camera operator for a video dating service, and a CCTV
          security guard at a supermarket. Cranston started working regularly in
          the late 1980s, mostly doing minor roles and advertisements. He was an
          original cast member of the ABC soap opera Loving, where he played
          Douglas Donovan from 1983 to 1985. Cranston starred in the short-lived
          series Raising Miranda in 1988. Cranston played Tom Logan in an
          episode of the first season of the TV series Baywatch in 1989.
          Cranston's voice acting includes English dubbing of Japanese anime
          (for which he primarily used the non-union pseudonym Lee Stone),
          including Macross Plus and Armitage III: Poly-Matrix, and most
          notably, Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie as Fei-Long, and the
          children's series Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Cranston did voice
          work for the 1993/1994 first season of that series, playing characters
          such as Twin Man and Snizzard, for which he was paid about $50 an hour
          for two or three hours of daily work. The Blue Power Ranger, Billy
          Cranston, was thought to be named for him but this has since proven
          false.
